# Training
Repository to play with git, python, etc, for technical writers. 


## I. Google writing exercise
### Documenting source code
The [http://github.com/kwiseth/Practice/findNeedles.java]`findNeedles.java` file was part of a Google test for technical writers (2014, 2017, but not used in 2020) with the following instructions:

> This section contains a short code sample written in Java. Please do the following:
> 1. Assume the sample appears in a document for programmers. Describe the code in some detail.
> You can use text, code comments, or any other techniques you like.
> 2. Assume you have a chance to send comments to the person who wrote the code. 
> Suggest ways to improve the code (for example, to reduce memory usage or enhance features).

Your writing should be ready for publication and should have a level of depth suitable for an experienced developer audience.

## II. Python basics
