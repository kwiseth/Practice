# Training
Repository to play with git, python, etc, for technical writers. 


## Google writing exercise
### Documenting source code
This Java method was part of a Google test for technical writers that I received in 2014 and 2017, with the following instructions:

>> This section contains a short code sample written in Java. Please do the following:
>> 1. Assume the sample appears in a document for programmers. Describe the code in some detail.
>> You can use text, code comments, or any other techniques you like.
>> 2. Assume you have a chance to send comments to the person who wrote the code. 
>> Suggest ways to improve the code (for example, to reduce memory usage or enhance features).
>> Your writing should be ready for publication and should have a level of depth suitable for an experienced developer audience.
